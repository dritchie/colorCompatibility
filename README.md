# colorcompatibility

Javascript port of [O'Donovan et al.'s data-driven color compatibility model](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~donovan/color/).
Specifically, this version was translated from [this Scala version](https://github.com/dritchie/SceneColorMaterial/blob/master/SegmentModel/src/colorinference/ColorCompatibility.scala), which was itself translated from the original Matlab code.

You can run a simple test case by running the main module directly, i.e. `node colorCompatibility.js`.
